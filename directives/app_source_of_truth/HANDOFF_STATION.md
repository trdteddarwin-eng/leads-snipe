# 🏁 LeadSnipe: The "Finish Line" Handoff

The core engine is built, the UI is premium monochrome, and the API bridge is operational. The baton is ready to be passed.

## 🚀 START HERE (Instructions for the next AI)
1.  **Read the Blueprint:** Review `/directives/app_source_of_truth/app_blueprint.md` for the full system map.
2.  **Start the Engine:** Run `python3 execution/leadsnipe_api.py`.
3.  **Launch the UI:** Open `http://localhost:8080/leadsnipe_homescreen_minimal.html`.
4.  **The Objective:** LeadSnipe is about finding the **Decision Maker** and **Texting/Emailing** them. Everything must focus on bypassing gatekeepers.

## 🏗️ Technical Handoff Summary

### Current Status: **Alpha (Functional API + UI)**

### API Bridge Stack:
- **FastAPI Core:** `execution/leadsnipe_api.py` manages the hunt queue, background threads, and status polling.
- **Polling Loop:** `leadsnipe_processing.html` fetches REAL updates from `/api/hunt/{id}/status`.
- **Dynamic Results:** `leadsnipe_results_list.html` and `leadsnipe_lead_detail.html` render real JSON data from the API.

### Infrastructure Details:
- **Hunt IDs:** Unique IDs generated per search (e.g., `hunt_20260102_abc123`).
- **Intermediate Files:** Raw data stored in `.tmp/` as JSON before final output.
- **Leads Output:** `leads.json` is the final source for the results page.

## 🛠️ NEXT STEPS (The Priority Backlog)
1.  **SQLite Persistence:** Replace the in-memory dict in `leadsnipe_api.py` with a simple SQLite table to survive server restarts.
2.  **Cancellation Logic:** Implement a way to kill/stop the subprocess chain if a user cancels the hunt.
3.  **Live Log Stream:** Add an endpoint to stream stdout from the subprocesses so the user can see exactly what the "Hunt" is doing (e.g., "Found John on LinkedIn...").
4.  **Gmail API Auth:** Finalize the OAuth loop to ensure the "Create Gmail Draft" button in `lead_detail.html` pushes the specific AI script to a real draft.
