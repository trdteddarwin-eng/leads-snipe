## The Core Value Proposition

### The "Leaky Bucket" Problem
For every missed call:
- **85%** of callers who hit voicemail call a competitor
- **Each missed call** = $300-$1,200 lost revenue
- **27%** of calls are missed by contractors
- **Response under 1 minute** = 391% higher conversion

### The ROI Pitch (Simple Math)
```
Cost of AI Receptionist: ~$300/month
Cost of ONE missed emergency job: $500-$1,200
Breakeven: Save just 1 call per month

Value of catching 5 extra calls/month: $2,500-$6,000
ROI: 700-2000%
```

## The Sales Approach

### 1. Diagnose, Don't Pitch
Don't lead with features. Lead with their problem.

**Wrong:** "We have an AI that answers calls 24/7 with natural language..."
**Right:** "85% of callers who hit voicemail call your competitor. How are you handling after-hours calls?"

### 2. Use Trigger-Based Outreach
Find specific signals on their website:
- Hiring a receptionist → "Need a bridge solution?"
- 24/7 emergency claims but 9-5 hours → "How do you handle 2am calls?"
- Running Google Ads → "If those leads are hitting voicemail, you're paying to send them to competitors"

### 3. Quantify the Pain
Always use numbers:
- "$1,200 walking out the door"
- "85% hang up on voicemail"
- "5 minutes delay = 80% drop in conversion"

### 4. One CTA Only
Don't ask for a 30-minute call AND offer to send a demo. Pick one:
- "Worth a quick chat?"
- "Can I send a 30-second recording?"
- "Curious if this resonates?"

## Objection Handling

### "We already have a receptionist"
**Response:** "That's great for 9-5. How do you handle the 11% of calls that come in after hours? Even one missed emergency call covers the cost of our AI for three months."

### "AI sounds robotic"
**Response:** "Modern AI has a Mean Opinion Score above 4.5—people can't tell the difference. Want to hear a 30-second demo? tedca.org"

### "We don't miss that many calls"
**Response:** "Have you tested it? I can submit an inquiry to your contact form right now and we'll see how long it takes to get a response. Most contractors are surprised."

### "We use voicemail"
**Response:** "The data shows 85% of callers hang up when they hit voicemail and call the next business. Voicemail is essentially a 'go to my competitor' message."

### "How much does it cost?"
**Response:** "Less than 1/10th the cost of a dispatcher. The real question is: how much is one missed emergency job? If it's $500+, the AI pays for itself by catching just one call."
